# Electric-Motor-Efficiency-Mapping

## Description
Electric Motor Efficiency Mapping is a program that was made to map the efficiency graph of an electric motor into numerical data with .xlsx or .csv format. This program is developed using MATLAB R2020a. Before the program is used, you need to edit the efficiency graph using any photo edditing apps, like the example below.

The colors of the graph is up to you. After the graph is edited, then the size of the graph needs to resize as big as the maximum value of the x and y axis of the graph. The example of the resized graph is shown below.

After that, open the program and change the name of the image in row 4 into your image's name. Run the program, and it will output a file in .csv format named "Efficiency Map.csv". There will be 3 columns data, where the first column will be the RPM data, the second column will be the torque data, and the last column will be the efficiency data.
